# Quantum-Encryption
Simulating quantum cryptography
(Doesn't actually work for obvious reasons that we don't need to measure/change state of anything to know what the encypted 'photon's' spins are)


<p>(...or can they)The idea:</p>
<p>Create H/V D/A public keys that everyone has access to</p>
<p>These keys have properties so that when they decrypt, incorrect basis will collapse the 'photons' to either the right or wrong state (..doesn't stop anyone from doing the test multiple times so they know whether it's right or wrong)</p>

# Quantum-Encryption
Simulating quantum cryptography
(Doesn't actually work for obvious reasons that we don't need to measure/change state of anything to know what the encypted 'photon's' spins are)


<p>(...or can they)Some ideas:</p>
<p>Create H/V D/A public keys that everyone has access to</p>
<p>These keys have properties so that when they decrypt, incorrect basis will collapse the 'photons' to either the right or wrong state (..doesn't stop anyone from doing the test multiple times so they know whether it's right or wrong)</p>
<p>Alice and Bob exchange information about the basis used and keep the info in the right basis</p>
<p>This idea doesn't work as quantum encryption (either yet or ever) because Eve could just keep the 'photons' and later when she knows about the correct basis measure it again to get the key. (Is there a way to make the 'photons' more like real photons so that their state changes after a measurement and the original cannot be kept...)</p>
<p>A database that keeps the universal true state of the photon? And updates after each measurement? Say in order to measure you will have to get the new state first, update it in order to get auth token, and then get the state at the same time of changing the state</p>
To be modified...
